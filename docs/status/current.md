# Current milestone

- Active milestone: physical memory management
- Subtask: begin deterministic early physical-memory map model and reporting contracts.
- Status: in progress
- Note: Codex writes code/docs only and waits for GitHub Actions feedback after merge to `main`.

## Done criteria
- [x] make fmt
- [x] make lint
- [x] make test
- [x] make build
- [x] make smoke
- [x] docs updated

## Progress update

- Completed slice: replaced the single shared early exception handler pointer with 32 vector-specific early stubs and wired the early IDT population path so each exception vector gets its own deterministic handler address.
- Completed slice: added kernel-owned deterministic exception log line contracts for vectors 0-31 plus an unknown-vector fallback, with host tests and smoke contract checks covering representative vectors and fallback behavior.
- Completed slice: wired firmware-path exception dispatch logging through kernel dispatch contracts (including CRLF-safe byte accessors), emitting a deterministic vector 14 page-fault line between interrupt init and completion logs.
- Completed slice: extended host transcript/smoke contracts so boot output ordering now enforces banner -> idt init -> exception vector 14 -> completion.
- Next slice: begin physical memory milestone with a deterministic host-side model for boot-time memory regions.
